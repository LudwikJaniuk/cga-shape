# cga-shape
Implementation of simplified cga-shape grammar

Okkk how do we do this

Occlusion testing? no
C++ or python? 
	Python would probably be simple wouldn't it.. can try to open one of the old projects and see if it's difficult or what
Rules specified how?
	since he mentioned PY functions , it's probably a good idea. Can we do an array of functions or something? 
	I suppose it would be an array of objects which contain
		source shape
		priority
		probability
		condition function
		evaluation function that returns the new elements
How is the input footprint to be given?
